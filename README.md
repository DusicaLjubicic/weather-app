This is a simple weather application built using Python and the built-in Tkinter library.

The main goal of this mini project is to demonstrate the usage of APIs, data extraction, and Python programming concepts.

To use the app, simply enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field, and the application will display the current weather.
